It's good, thanks. But how to ignore some directories, such as target, out, production?
sebastiansulinski commented on 3 Jul 2014

Great resource - many thanks for sharing.

Some examples with directories per https://gist.github.com/ThomsonTang suggestion would help round out this already excellent tip

Thanks used this a number of times on projects
VinnyFonseca commented on 13 Aug 2014

I think .dll files are important if you're developing with .NET.

Also, you could include .ai, .eps, and .psd on it.

Thanks, for the great snippet.
Adrien-Depraute commented on 22 Aug 2014

Some windows files too;

Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

arulrajnet commented on 31 Dec 2014

To ignore backup files generated by text editor anywhere in the subdirectory

**/*~

To ignore IDE (eclipse / intellij) related files

.classpath
.project
.settings
.idea
.metadata
*.iml
*.ipr

davidperezgar commented on 12 Jan

And What about Iconr?
pramitchoudhary commented on 13 Jan

This is very helpful. Thanks guys
danielcosta commented 25 days ago

@arulrajnet @cptstarling it is not recommended to ignore entire .idea directory. Instead we should add only the two lines below to local .gitignore file:

/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/tasks.xml

This way all good project configuration (for example Code Style, namespaces mapping, etc) will be shared among all team.
